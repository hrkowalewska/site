title: "Female Breadwinner Families in Europe"
summary: "<strong>ESRC Research Fellow</strong> - grant no. ES/N00082X/1, PI: Dr Agnese Vitali.<br/><br/>Despite the increase of female-breadwinner families in developed countries, little is known about who these couples are, how and why they emerge, and what trends in female breadwinning mean for women, men and children. <br/><br/> This project aims to answer such questions and in so doing will contribute to the debate on gender, money and the distribution of power between men and women in couples.
