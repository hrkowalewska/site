Women’s experiences of re-entering employment in later life remain largely
invisible in academic research and society. This project will spotlight these
experiences through in-depth, qualitative interviews with unemployed/inactive
women aged 50-65 who are seeking re-employment across England. Studies have
considered previous cohorts, but not these late-Boomer and early-Gen-X women.
These women were a turning point in women’s employment rights and expectations;
yet, many have no choice but to work for longer amid UK State Pension Age
increases, welfare cuts, the cost-of-living crisis, and pension privatisation.
The biographical approach will highlight the influence of earlier life events on
these women’s labour market experiences today, while its intersectional approach
will elucidate differences by class, family status, and ethnicity.

This project is funded by a British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grant
(SRG24\240203) and will run from January 2025 for 24 months.
