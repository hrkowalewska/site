abstract: "
In analysing heterosexual couples’ work-family arrangements over time and
space, the comparative social policy literature has settled on the framework of the
‘male-breadwinner’ versus ‘dual-earner’ family. Yet, in assuming men in couplefamilies are (full-time) employed, this framework overlooks another work-family
arrangement, which is the ‘female-breadwinner’ couple. Including femalebreadwinner couples matters because of their growing prevalence and, as our
analysis shows, greater economic vulnerability. We perform descriptive and
regression analyses of Luxembourg Income Study microdata to compare
household incomes for female-breadwinner couples and other couple-types
across 20 industrialised countries. We then consider how labour earnings and
benefit incomes vary for ‘pure’ breadwinner couples comprising one wage-earner
and one inactive/unemployed partner according to the gender of the breadwinner.
We find that pure female breadwinners have lower average individual earnings
than male breadwinners, even after controlling for sociodemographic
characteristics and occupational and working-time differences. Furthermore,
welfare systems across most countries are not working hard enough to
compensate for the female breadwinner earnings penalty, including in socialdemocratic countries. Once controls are included in our regression models, it
never happens that pure female breadwinners have higher disposable household
incomes than pure male breadwinners. Thus, our study adds to a growing body of
evidence showing that female-breadwinner families sit at the intersection of
multiple disadvantages. In turn, these couples offer comparative scholars of the
welfare state an ‘acid test’ case study for how effectively families are protected
from social risk. Our results additionally highlight how cross-national differences
in the female breadwinner income disadvantage do not fit neatly with established
welfare typologies, suggesting other factors – in particular, labour market
characteristics and the economic cycle – are also at play.
