abstract: "
Employer attitudes towards maternity leave are often framed as a tension between opposition based on
costs or ideal worker norms, versus normative or ethical support. How do employers combine and
prioritise these justifications in practice? Drawing on interviews with thirty-seven British managers, this
article develops a typology of employers– risk-averse, business-first, and value-driven– distinguishing the
nature of support and underlying blends of economic, normative, and moral justifications. It shows how
moral reasoning– often assumed to align only with a supportive stance– is also mobilised to justify
exclusionary attitudes and even overt discrimination against maternity leave-takers. Further, against
assumptions that shifting cultural norms and expanding rights foster greater employer support, discomfort
with these changes can reinforce resistance. Relational dynamics also shape attitudes, with positive
affective–personal ties between managers and staff prompting greater support. These findings offer a new
lens on how family leave rights are interpreted in everyday managerial practice.
