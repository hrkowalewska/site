## Study Information

Women aged 50+ make important contributions to the UK labour market and have become a key target
group for employment policies. However, few studies have spoken with women in this age group to hear
about their experiences of job loss and job-seeking in a post-Covid world.

With your help, this study seeks to better understand what unemployment is like for women aged 50+
today. We aim to find out how these experiences are shaped by key employment and life events in
women’s pasts, and how they might vary by certain characteristics, like skill level.

## How to sign up

If you're interested in taking part, please fill in the questionnaire (link below), which takes
about 10-15 minutes. We’ll get back to you within two weeks.

## Eligibility

To be eligible, you must:

- Be a woman aged 50 years or over
- Have experienced involuntary job loss at some point since March 2020

You are eligible to take part whether you are still unemployed, have found new work since being
unemployed, or have stopped looking for work (for example, by taking early retirement or becoming a
carer).

Exclusion criteria:

- You left your previous job by choice
- You were furloughed only and kept your job

## What’s involved in the study

One interview lasting 1-2 hours, at a date, time, and location of your choice. The interview can be
online or in person, it’s up to you. 

## What you’ll get for taking part

You’ll also be helping researchers to better understand the specific experiences of women aged 50+
during unemployment. Most research to date has focused on younger age groups or men aged over 50.

In turn, your participation can inform policies that better support the specific needs of women
experiencing unemployment in their 50s and beyond. Your participation can also increase awareness
among employers about some of the barriers women aged 50+ might face in finding work, so they can
address these. It may also help other women going through unemployment to hear about your
experiences.

## Confidentiality

All the information received will be treated in the strictest confidence, and will be stored in
accordance with current UK data protection legislation. As a participant, you’ll have access to your
own data on request. Your name and any other identifying information will never be disclosed or
identifiable in any presentation or publication of the research.
