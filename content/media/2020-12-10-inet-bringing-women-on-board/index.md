# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "[inet.ox.ac.uk](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/news/20th-november-is-equal-pay-day/), 20 November 2020: Today is ‘Equal Pay Day’, meaning that from today until the end of the year, women will effectively work for free because of the UK’s gender pay gap. Women working full time earn, on average, 11.5% less than men – this is the equivalent to around six weeks of lost pay, which covers the period from today until December 31st."
