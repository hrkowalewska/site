# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "[blog.esrc.ac.uk](https://blog.esrc.ac.uk/2016/11/22/what-women-dont-want-how-many-countries-still-mummy-track-women/), 22 November 2016: Women earn 33 per cent less than men on average by the time their first child is 12 years old, according to a recent report on the UK. This is mainly because women are more likely than men to take career breaks for children and return as mothers to work in more poorly paid ‘flexible’ and part-time ‘mummy track’ careers that are often well below their skill level."
