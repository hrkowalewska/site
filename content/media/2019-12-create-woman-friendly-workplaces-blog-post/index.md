# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "[socialpolicyblog.com](https://socialpolicyblog.com/2019/12/16/bringing-women-on-boards-to-create-women-friendly-workplaces/), 16 December 2019: While debates on bringing more women onto companies’ boards have raged for many years, they have really gained traction since the early-2010s. Arguments in favour of gender-diverse boards generally focus on the business case or justice and equality. My article draws attention to another important but often overlooked benefit: the creation of more ‘women-friendly’ workplaces."
