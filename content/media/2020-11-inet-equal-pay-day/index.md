# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "[inet.ox.ac.uk](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/news/bringing-women-on-board-how-government-policies-can-improve-gender-diversity-in-top-jobs/), 10 December 2020: The issue of women’s board membership has become hotly contested in recent years. Achieving a ‘critical mass’ of women on boards matters because these jobs carry various benefits, from job satisfaction to high pay and status. Bringing more women into positions of power can also lead to more ‘women-friendly’ workplaces, with less sexual harassment, more developed work-family supports, and better pay for women at lower levels."
