I’m a Lecturer in Social Policy at the University of Bath. Currently, I’m working on a [New Investigator Grant](/project/esrc-new-investigators-grant/) funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, which looks at the relationship between social policies and women’s employment across advanced economies. Prior to this, I held postdoc positions at the University of Oxford and the University of Southampton, where I also received my [PhD](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/417383/1/Helen_Kowalewska_Minor_Corrections.pdf) in 2018. My research has been published in [Work, Employment & Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0950017020971221), [Journal of European Social Policy](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0958928716673316), [Journal of Social Policy](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047279419000722), and [Social Policy & Society](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1474746415000330) and has been featured in the media, such as in [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/household-earnings-sole-women-men-gender-us-west-europe-salary-a8894426.html).
